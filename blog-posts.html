              One-shots are snack-sized adventures that allow you to get right
              into the action of Dungeons & Dragons without the baggage that
              comes with an extended campaign. In addition, the self-contained
              nature of one-shots enables players and Dungeon Masters to more
              easily experiment with the breadth of options D&D provides without
              commitment. Maybe you want to play as a party of meme characters,
              complete with janky multiclassing shenanigans? Or perhaps your DM
              wants to try their hardest to brutally kill the characters one by
              one? Whatever avenue you're looking to explore with your one-shot,
              it can make for a fun night of gaming!
            </p>
            <p>
              In this article, we're paying homage to one-shot adventures in
              D&D. We'll discuss why we love them, some tips for running them,
              and our favorite one-shot adventures!

              What Is a One-Shot?
            </h2>
            <p class="callout__text">
              One-shots are D&D adventures that can be finished in one 3-4 hour
              session. These adventures are more streamlined because of the
              tight turnaround time. One-shot adventures are usually meant to be
              self-contained, not needing any context from outside of the
              adventure to be run.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </div>
        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <div class="prose">
          <h2>Why We Love One-Shots</h2>
          <p>
            One-shots are a casual way to get a session of D&D in without the
            legwork that comes with a campaign. Players can try out new builds
            and personalities, while DMs don't have to worry about managing a
            campaign, keeping notes, or writing a continuous narrative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing as one-shots lack the commitment of an extended campaign,
            they provide a number of unique benefits:
          </p>

          <h3>Switch Up the Group Dynamic</h3>
          <p>
            One-shots are the perfect time to allow aspiring DMs at your table
            to step up for a session. While long-term campaigns might be
            daunting for a new DM, one-session adventures that don't require as
            much backstory, planning, and management are excellent ways to gain
            experience. One of the most prominent benefits of this is that it
            gives your table's "forever DM" a break.
          </p>
          <p>
            While switching up DMs is one of the best ways to experience a
            different table dynamic, switching party roles can be another way to
            completely change the feel of your game. Maybe your peaceful cleric
            is tired of healing your party and wants to rage as a barbarian? Or
            maybe your warlock wants to go on the straight and narrow with a
            paladin?
          </p>
          <h3>Try New Things</h3>
          <p>
            If you're anything like me, you have 10 janky character builds ready
            to go at all times. One-shots are the perfect time to try out your
            new creations without the stakes of being stuck with the same
            character for 100 sessions (or until they meet their untimely
            demise).
          </p>
          <p>
            This can also allow you to experiment with different campaign
            settings. If your group is used to playing in a traditional fantasy
            setting, one-shots are an excellent way to expand your horizons. The
            adventure anthology
            <a
              href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/settings/journeys-through-the-radiant-citadel?icid_medium=ddb&icid_source=article&icid_campaign=one-shots&icid_content=radiant-citadel&pid=SRC-00087"
              >Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel</a
            >
            could be an ideal starting point for tables looking to experience
            unique takes on fantasy while sticking to the one-session adventure
            format.
          </p>
          <h3>Play D&D Without the Strings</h3>
          <p>
            Agreeing to play D&D usually comes with a commitment. If your group
            can't dedicate a night every week (or two … or four …. or eight) to
            D&D, one-shots are the perfect option to get some game time while
            you have everyone together. If you're hanging out with friends and
            looking for something to do, a one-shot is much easier to put
            together than a campaign!
          </p>
          <p>
            One-shots are also a great way to introduce new players to the game.
            The focus on straightforward gameplay will help streamline the
            player's learning, and the reduced obligation can make things easier
            for those with a busy schedule. You can even help the newer players
            by offering pregenerated characters, so they can focus on gameplay
            rather than the myriad of options they're presented with during
            <a

              >character creation</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h3>Enjoy a Themed Play Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Personally, my time to run a one-shot is for a holiday, like
            Halloween, Valentine's Day, or Christmas. One-shots work
            particularly well for the over-the-top spooky or goofy themes these
            celebrations often inspire. While these grandiose tropes would get
            tiresome over the course of an extended campaign, one-shots are
            often the perfect dose of festive holiday spirit!
